🔹 TECHNOLOGY STACK
Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + shadcn/ui

Backend: Express.js + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL

Dev Environment: Replit (cloud IDE), Vite (frontend bundler)

Deployment Target: Replit-hosted monorepo with .env secrets and local build

✅ CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED
1. 🔄 Scroll Misbehavior
Symptoms: Reloading or navigating sometimes starts at the bottom of the page.

Cause: React Router does not manage scroll on navigation by default.

Fix:

Add a global ScrollToTop.tsx component to reset scroll on pathname change.

2. 🧭 Broken Navbar Navigation
Symptoms: Top bar buttons (Home, About, Services, etc.) fail to respond when already on the corresponding route.

Cause: Handlers assume navigation = rerender; doesn’t handle scroll targets.

Fix:

Abstract logic to detect if you're already on the page, then manually scrollIntoView().

3. 🏷️ Content Misnaming
Issue: “Voice Solutions” still present—must be replaced with “DSX Voice”.

Fix:

Run a global replacement (grep/sed or VSCode multi-file search).

4. 🔼 "Home" Button Does Not Scroll Up
Issue: Clicking "Home" does not scroll to top when already on homepage.

Fix:

Force window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' }) on "Home" click.

🔐 SECURITY & RELIABILITY REVIEW
Area	Status	Recommendation
CORS	⚠️ Likely Default	Restrict origins explicitly
Input Validation	❌	Add zod or yup schema guards
Secrets in Logs	⚠️	Ensure process.env is never logged
HTTPS	⚠️ Replit only	For production, proxy via Netlify/Cloudflare
Rate Limiting	❌	Install express-rate-limit
Auth	❌	Optional for now; consider for admin CMS

🧪 QUALITY ASSURANCE & DX
Category	Status	Suggestion
Testing	❌ None	Add Vitest (client) + Supertest (server)
Linting	⚠️ Basic or missing	Use ESLint + Prettier across project
CI/CD	❌	Add GitHub Actions or a local run.sh
README	⚠️ Sparse	Add full setup instructions, .env examples, Replit caveats
Asset Mgmt	⚠️	Audit Tailwind classes, image sizes, fonts

📜 AI CODER SYSTEM PROMPT
You are an elite full-stack AI software engineer assigned to harden and improve a React + Express portfolio project. The application is hosted on Replit and built with:

Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + shadcn/ui

Backend: Express.js + TypeScript + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL

Bundler: Vite

Hosting: Replit with .env config, no CI/CD

Your mission:

🚧 UX/UI FIXES
Fix scroll reset on route changes using ScrollToTop.tsx.

Refactor top navbar so that:

Clicking “Home” always scrolls to the top, even if on /.

Buttons scroll to internal sections with smooth behavior (use scrollIntoView).

Replace all "Voice Solutions" text instances with "DSX Voice".

🔐 SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS
Add middleware: helmet, express-rate-limit, and CORS with whitelist.

Ensure process.env secrets are not printed or exposed in logs.

Input validation with zod (or yup) on all server API endpoints.

⚙️ INFRASTRUCTURE & BUILD
Serve frontend from Express via app.use(express.static("dist")).

Add vite build → dist/ → Express server fallback route.

Add run.sh: lint, test, build, launch.

✅ QUALITY ASSURANCE
Install and configure:

eslint, prettier

vitest for React unit tests

supertest for Express API testing

Add .env.example and full README setup guide.
