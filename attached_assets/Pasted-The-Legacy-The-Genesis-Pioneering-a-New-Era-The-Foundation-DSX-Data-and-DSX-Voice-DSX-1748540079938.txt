This gives him the ability to quickly isolate issues in a crisis as well as to see long term trends which will have a critical impact on business planning.

Kirk developed DSX DATA’s first data center and is the architect of the DSX VOICE service.  A seasoned business and technology veteran, he has a deep understanding of the ever-increasing demands of business operations, the complexity of program development and the need for continuous improvement. Before founding DSX DATA and DSX VOICE, he served as CEO and CTO of a number of companies and worked with the National Security Agency and the Department of the Navy to do cross-domain security research and consulting.
